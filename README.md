# Matcher

The project demonstrates: 
<br/>Examples of pattern matching for my elixir talk ðŸ˜…
<br/>Examples of guards in elixir.
<br/>Examples implementing custom gaurds.

Inside the pattern matching module there are documentations of all things possible to pattern match in @docs.

This project uses a mix task called matcher for active development. Instead of using iex and having to rebuild state each time I copy the state into the mix task. If this does not make any sense just follow the install instructions. ðŸ™‚ 

## Installation
```
git clone 
mix matcher
mix test
```

witchcraft is not implemented but could provide additional syntax for matching and guards: https://github.com/expede/witchcraft
