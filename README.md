# Matcher

Examples of pattern matching for my elixir talk ðŸ˜…

This project uses a mix task called matcher for active development. Instead of using iex and having to rebuild state each time I copy the state into the mix task. If this does not make any sense just follow the install instructions. ðŸ™‚ 

Hopefully I have some tests before the meetup. ðŸ˜…

## Installation
```
git clone 
mix matcher
mix test
```
